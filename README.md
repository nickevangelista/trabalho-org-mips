# 32-bit MIPS Processor Project
## Description
This project was developed by UERGS students for the Computer Organization course. It implements a simplified 32-bit MIPS processor architecture, designed to execute a selected set of instructions using a multicyle datapath and unified memory system.
### Instruction Set
The processor supports six core MIPS instructions:
- ADD – Arithmetic addition (R-type)
- SUB – Arithmetic subtraction (R-type)
- AND – Bitwise AND (R-type)
- LW – Load Word (I-type)
- SW – Store Word (I-type)
- BEQ – Branch if Equal (I-type)

JUMP – Unconditional jump (J-type)
